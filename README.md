# dmrg

A simple, but inefficient, implementation of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). 
At this point, I have begun to implement a version of the code to solve the Heisenberg Model at any number of sites.
